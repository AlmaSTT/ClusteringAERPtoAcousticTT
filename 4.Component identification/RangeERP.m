
function ERPrange=RangeERP(ERP,ITC,COHS)
%%
%Function that has as input ERP, ITC with size n x m x fs and COEH with a size of n x m, where 'n' corresponds
%to the number of subjects, â€™m' to the number of channels and 'fs' to the frequency of
%sampling. Having as an output a matrix with the same dimensions, which
%correct to values that exceed the humbral of the ITC.
